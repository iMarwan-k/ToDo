# ToDo


## What I learned
* More practice on TableView and using UITableViewController as a screen rather than regular UIViewController
    - With UITableViewController, you don't need to setup delegate or datasource because that comes with UITableViewController
* Using UserDefaults to store small amounts of data and learn how to get data back. This is not a database 
* Singleton: guarantees that only one instance of a class is instantiated
* Working with Encoder to add file to the system file manager
* Working with Decoder to retrieve data from custom plist file and add it content to our veritable
* Working with Core Data and learn how to Create, Remove, Update, Delete (CRUD) tasks with core data
* Working with NSFetchRequest, Predicate, sortDescriptors, CompoundPredicate
* Lazy ver: is to load that ver only when it is time to use it 
* Learning about didset{} which means what should happen when the variable get set
* Working with searchbar and how to query Core Data
* Working with Realm DB
